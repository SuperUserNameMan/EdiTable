# EdiTable
A Tab Separated Value spreadsheet (TSV) file that can be displayed as HTML table and edited in a spreadsheet editor.

## WTF is this ?

`example.csv.html` contains a Tab Separated Value (TSV) spreadsheet with a `<script>` element as last line.

If you open it with a web browser, the TSV will be converted into a beautifull (matter of taste) HTML Table. 
This HTML table can be sorted just by clicking over the column header of your choice.

If you rename this file `test.csv`, you can open and edit it using a spreadsheet editor.
Once you're done updating the TSV, just add the `.html` extension back to the filename, and you can display it into your browser again.
